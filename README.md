# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continuously exploring new programming languages to expand my skill set. This project demonstrates my understanding of Kotlin by implementing a fully functional Hangman game. 
The game allows users to guess words from two categories: colors and animals, while also visually constructing a stick figure as correct guesses are made.

The purpose of this software is to practice Kotlin's core programming concepts, including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and data structures. 
Additionally, it enhances my ability to build interactive console-based applications while reinforcing error handling and user input validation.
